# dev-setup
My development set-up for elementary os/mac os (avoid elementary specific scripts for mac os. All fonts are preloaded in mac os).
This set-up should work on Pop os too. 

### Warning!
Ubuntu requires to install 'flatpak' manually before using install_elementary_apps.sh. It may require to add flathub remote, as I prefer and use flatpaks (from flathub remote) over Ubuntu's default snaps.
